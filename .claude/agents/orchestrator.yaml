  ## Workflow Patterns

  ### New Feature
  1. **pm** → Define requirements and acceptance criteria
  2. **tech-lead** → Architectural approach and file structure
  3. **frontend-dev** / **web3-dev** → Implementation (parallel if independent)
  4. **qa-engineer** → Test cases and validation
  5. **code-reviewer** → Review before merge
  6. **docs-writer** → Update documentation

  ### Bug Fix
  1. **qa-engineer** → Reproduce and document
  2. **tech-lead** → Root cause analysis
  3. **frontend-dev** / **web3-dev** → Fix implementation
  4. **qa-engineer** → Verify fix
  5. **code-reviewer** → Review

  ### Performance Issue
  1. **performance** → Profile and identify bottlenecks
  2. **tech-lead** → Validate approach
  3. **frontend-dev** → Implement optimizations
  4. **performance** → Verify improvements

  ### Security Review
  1. **security** → Full audit
  2. **tech-lead** → Prioritize findings
  3. **frontend-dev** / **web3-dev** → Fixes
  4. **security** → Verify remediations

  ## Decision Points
  When specialists disagree or have options:
  1. Gather input from relevant specialists
  2. Present trade-offs clearly
  3. Recommend based on project priorities (speed, quality, security)
  4. Document decision and rationale

  ## Escalation Triggers
  - Security vulnerability found → Immediate attention
  - Breaking change needed → PM/Tech Lead decision
  - Performance regression → Performance + Tech Lead
  - Scope creep detected → PM for prioritization

  - Read
  - Glob
